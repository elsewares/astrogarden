Researchers submitted entirely AI-generated exam answers to the undergraduate psychology department
of a “reputable” UK university. The vast majority went undetected and the AI answers achieved higher
scores than real students.

“We report a rigorous, blind study in which we injected 100% AI written submissions into the
examinations system in five undergraduate modules, across all years of study, for a BSc degree in
Psychology at a reputable UK university. We found that **94% of our AI submissions were
undetected**. The grades awarded to our AI submissions were on average **half a grade boundary
higher than that achieved by real students**. Across modules there was an 83.4% chance that the AI
submissions on a module would outperform a random selection of the same number of real student
submissions.”

I have to assume educators are swiftly moving to hand-written exams under supervised conditions and
oral exams. Anything else seems to negate the point of exams.
